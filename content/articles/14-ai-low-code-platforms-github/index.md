Recently, while browsing the [r/AI\_Agents](https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1iwsiby/best_lowcode_ai_agent_builder/) subreddit on Reddit, I came across a question that felt surprisingly real:

![Reddit1.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/image%20(1)-qx24dx.png)

> *‚ÄúIs there any low-code tool that actually lets AI execute tasks and run workflows?‚Äù*

It sounds like a simple question, but it hits a pain point many developers share. There are plenty of ‚ÄúAI-powered low-code platforms‚Äù out there, but most of them only add a chat box ‚Äî maybe they generate some SQL or form fields. But tools that let AI truly run workflows, call APIs, and function as an agent are still rare.

Then the comments started to split. Someone bluntly said:

![Reddit2.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/image-4j39lb.png)

> *‚ÄúThese AI no-code platforms won‚Äôt last a year. If AI is really that powerful, it shouldn‚Äôt still rely on drag-and-drop flowcharts to work.‚Äù*

It‚Äôs a harsh take, but it also reflects a real concern: **If AI is already so capable, why do we still need no-code? Are these drag-and-drop tools destined to become obsolete?**

The interesting thing is ‚Äî that comment was posted **eight months ago**. And today, not only are these tools still around, many have grown more mature, with even more new projects emerging.

Just a few days ago, we compiled üí°[The Most Popular Open-Source No-Code AI Tools on GitHub](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/top-11-github-open-source-no-code-ai-tools)\. Looking at stars, community activity, and feature maturity, many of these tools are not only alive ‚Äî they‚Äôre actively improving and expanding their AI capabilities.
This shows that no-code/low-code + AI isn‚Äôt a short-lived hype ‚Äî it‚Äôs something real, being built, used, and evolving.

That said, skepticism still matters. Another comment put it clearly:

![Reddit3.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/img_v3_02rc_522ac857-0534-4006-ae62-6b989e7e13bg-v1yz3w.png)

> *‚ÄúLook into open-source alternatives ‚Äî most low-code AI tools are still in their early stages.
> But most importantly: know exactly what problem you‚Äôre solving before choosing a tool.
> A lot of so-called ‚ÄòAI Agents‚Äô are really just traditional automation with an LLM stuck on top.‚Äù*

It‚Äôs hard to argue with that. Many ‚ÄúAI agent platforms‚Äù do little more than connect automation flows to an LLM ‚Äî smarter on the surface, but still just tools.

We‚Äôve covered related topics before, like üí°[Noteworthy Open-Source AI Agent Projects](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/github-open-source-ai-agent-projects) and üí°[Great Open-Source AI Tools](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/github-open-source-ai-projects).

But this time, instead of asking ‚ÄúCan AI build systems?‚Äù, we‚Äôre shifting the focus naturally from no-code to low-code.

No-code is about enabling non-technical users to use AI ‚Äî you don‚Äôt write code, but you can call models or generate content.

Low-code, however, is for people who understand the business and know a bit of tech ‚Äî it focuses on **data modeling, process logic, permission systems, and plugin extensibility**, which are closer to real system building.

So, we looked into the [GitHub‚Äúlow-code‚Äù](https://github.com//topics/low-code) topic and focused on tools that:

* ‚≠ê Have active communities and good maintenance (stars, updates, feedback)
* ü§ñ Clearly provide AI capabilities in their docs, not just a chatbot window
* üõ†Ô∏è Support self-hosting or extensions and can actually be used in production environments

Based on this, we shortlisted 14 representative low-code platforms that truly integrate AI.

They each take different paths ‚Äî some help build business systems, some focus on agent workflows, and some specialize in data and spreadsheet applications.

Before diving into details, here‚Äôs an overview table showing how each of these 14 tools positions AI üëá

## **AI + Smart Spreadsheets / Database Tools**

These tools don‚Äôt focus on workflow execution or full business systems ‚Äî their core value lies in making data and spreadsheets smarter.

Here, AI is mainly used for generating, completing, querying, and analyzing data ‚Äî not for handling complex business logic.

They can be seen as ‚ÄúAirtable / Notion Database enhanced with AI‚Äù, ideal for data-driven teams, content operations, or knowledge management ‚Äî rather than heavy business systems or workflow automation.

### **NocoDB**

‚≠ê 58.4k

  AI features include field suggestions, content generation, auto-completion, and smart insights for data analysis.

### **Teable**

## **Tools That Don‚Äôt Fully Fit Into the Above Categories**

During our research, we also found tools that don‚Äôt completely fall into any of the three main categories ‚Äî such as **Onlook**.

‚≠ê 22.9k

Website: [https://onlook.com/](https://onlook.com/)

GitHub: [https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook](https://github.com/onlook-dev/onlook)

![Onlook.png](https://static-docs.nocobase.com/Onlook-bnn4iz.png)

What makes Onlook different is that its core capability is ‚ÄúAI-generated UI interfaces.‚Äù

With natural language or wireframes, AI can automatically generate page layouts, UI components, and even React code. These tools sit between design platforms and frontend low-code development, focusing on AI-assisted UI creation.

## **Tools That Span More Than One Category ‚Äî Such as NocoBase**

Earlier, we grouped tools into three types ‚Äî business application builders, workflow/agent tools, and data/table intelligence platforms.
But in practice, some platforms span multiple categories ‚Äî and **NocoBase is the most complete and architecturally unified among them.**

Unlike most tools, NocoBase brings together capabilities from multiple dimensions:

* Like a data platform, it provides database tables, fields, views, and APIs.
* Like a business system builder, it can generate pages, forms, permissions, page logic, and relational models.
* Through plugins and its open architecture, it can also extend into workflows, automation, and even embed AI nodes to execute parts of a process.

Of course, there are other tools with some cross-category features as well:

* Appsmith, ToolJet, Budibase ‚Äî while mainly UI builders, they also support lightweight flows such as ‚Äúbutton click ‚Üí API ‚Üí write data‚Äù.
* NocoDB, Teable ‚Äî data-centric tools that now include AI autofill, webhook triggers, and basic rule automation.

However, these tools mostly add small AI features on top of their core functionality, making the experience smoother ‚Äî but they do not form full workflow engines or complete system capabilities, and their extensibility is limited.

In contrast, NocoBase is not just ‚Äúcovering more areas‚Äù, but a true hybrid platform ‚Äî starting from data modeling at the core, extending to pages and permissions, and further to workflows and AI via plugins. This level of architectural integration is rare among open-source low-code platforms.

## **Final Thoughts**

We used to build systems by writing code. Then came drag-and-drop interfaces. Now, more and more people are starting to describe how a system should work ‚Äî and let AI help build it.

> *‚ÄúAI doesn‚Äôt remove the work ‚Äî it just moves the work.‚Äù*

The real challenge is no longer whether we are using AI, but whether we can deeply integrate AI with business logic, data, and workflows, and make it a part of the system itself.

AI is moving from a conversation tool to a construction tool. It isn‚Äôt perfect yet, but the direction is clear.
In the future, systems may not be ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù ‚Äî they may be described. And we will start from real business problems, not just from a code editor.

If you‚Äôve read this far and feel the same shift happening, feel free to share this list with others who care about **AI √ó low-code**.üëç

## **Introduction**

In the design of no-code and low-code platforms, **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** is an unavoidable topic.  Whether for team collaboration, data security, or managing multi-module systems, the moment user-resource boundaries appear, roles and permissions become essential.

Developers and enterprise users have long paid close attention to RBAC — it’s not only a pillar of platform security but also a key factor influencing scalability and maintainability.

On Reddit, discussions around this topic are constant.

> “Every time I try to add user authentication with roles and permissions, things fall apart. The logic seems straightforward, but the execution breaks down, especially once I start layering role-based access.”

He only wanted to set up three roles in a small directory app — regular user, merchant, and admin.

The logic was simple and common, but once implemented, nested permission logic caused system complexity to skyrocket. RBAC quickly became the most error-prone part of the project.

Another kind of confusion often comes from the opposite direction.  In the **r/nocode** community, someone pointed out:

> “Budibase says it’s open source, but user limits apply. Appsmith says granular access control is only available in the paid plan.”

Most no-code or low-code platforms still fall short in permission management:  either permissions are too coarse, limited to page or module level, or fine-grained role and data access controls are only available in enterprise or paid tiers.  As a result, teams are forced to balance **security** against **cost**.

At its core, the RBAC model answers a simple question:

> Who (User) can perform what (Permission) on which resource (Resource)?

The difficulty lies in the complexity of this mapping within no/low-code environments. Platforms must handle diverse roles — developers, business users, external clients — while managing multiple resource layers such as tables, fields, pages, and workflow nodes.  They need to allow visual configuration while ensuring logical consistency — a key challenge many platforms face in implementing RBAC.

In our earlier article, *“[How to Design an RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) System](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/how-to-design-rbac-role-based-access-control-system)”* we explored this mechanism in depth — from how roles and resources are abstracted, to designing field- and condition-level permissions, and maintaining clear boundaries in multi-role collaboration.  Those insights provide the foundation for this article — understanding how various platforms balance trade-offs in RBAC implementation.

In this comparison, we evaluate six representative no/low-code platforms — NocoBase, Retool, OutSystems, Appsmith, Budibase, and Mendix — across three dimensions: permission granularity, flexibility, and user experience.

Before we dive into each platform, here’s an overview table highlighting their main differences and characteristics 👇

For reference:

> ★ = Coarse granularity
>
> ★★★★★ = Fine granularity


| Platform   | Open Source                     | Permission Granularity                                                                            | Flexibility                                                                         | User Experience                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| NocoBase   | Open source (self-hosted)       | ★★★★★ Field-, condition-, action-, and API-level permissions with visual rule configuration. | High — plugin-based architecture with an extensible permission model.              | Intuitive visual setup, ideal for multi-role teams.      |
| Appsmith   | Open source (community edition) | ★★★★☆ Page-, query-, and data source-level permissions; some advanced features are paid.     | High — supports both preset and custom roles, with attribute-level access control. | User-friendly interface and low learning curve.          |
| Budibase   | Open source (self-hosted)       | ★★★★ Table-, view-, and page-level permissions; limited conditional logic.                    | Medium-high — supports role hierarchy and conditional rules.                       | Easy to configure, great for small to mid-sized teams.   |
| Mendix     | Proprietary / Commercial        | ★★★★ Module-, entity-, page-, and process-level permissions.                                  | Medium — flexible but requires developer participation.                            | Stable and enterprise-oriented with strong governance.   |
| Retool     | Proprietary / Commercial        | ★★★★ App/resource/query-level permissions; enterprise edition adds row-level security.        | Medium-high — uses permission groups and resource rules.                           | Powerful but complex to configure and relatively costly. |
| OutSystems | Proprietary / Commercial        | ★★★★ Screen-, module-, and data-level permissions; custom extensions required.                | Medium — clear structure but limited flexibility.                                  | Enterprise-grade security with a mature model.           |

* 🟡 **Appsmith:** Balanced and easy to use, great for internal tools, but advanced access features are paywalled.
* 🟡 **Budibase:** Simple and fast to learn for small teams; limited permission depth and user caps remain its drawbacks.
* 🟠 **Mendix / OutSystems:** Robust, enterprise-grade systems with strong integration and governance, yet high setup complexity and cost.
* 🟠 **Retool:** Secure and user-friendly, though per-user control across large apps still needs manual logic.

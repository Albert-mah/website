## Introduction

Over the past year, AI and no-code have come together much faster than anyone expected. **It‚Äôs no longer just about adding an AI feature ‚Äî it‚Äôs changing the way we build applications.**

No-code is also going through a clear shift: instead of simply designing interfaces, creating data models, and setting up workflows, we‚Äôre moving toward a new stage where AI helps model data, generate logic, and work alongside us to build entire systems. And this shift is already happening in real products ‚Äî not just as a concept.

In this article, we reviewed no-code projects on GitHub and selected open-source tools that have integrated AI or offer intelligent features. We organized them into this ‚ÄúAI + No-code Tool List‚Äù by their GitHub star count.

This follows our list from last year, ***[The Most Starred Open-source No-code Tools on GitHub](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/the-top-12-open-source-no-code-tools-with-the-most-github-stars)***. But this time, it‚Äôs not just about who has more stars ‚Äî it‚Äôs about who is actually making AI useful and reusable in real scenarios.

If you‚Äôre exploring **AI tools, workflow automation, Agent building, or planning to create an intelligent application**, this list is a great place to start.

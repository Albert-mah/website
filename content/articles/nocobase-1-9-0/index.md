### [Async Task Manager] Support for Service Splitting via Environment Variables and Queues

Introduces a new service splitting mechanism, allowing asynchronous task and workflow services to run independently through the `WORKER_MODE` environment variable — enabling multi-node deployment and performance optimization.

### Graceful Shutdown Lifecycle Support

Introduces graceful shutdown handling.
When the application process receives a SIGTERM or SIGINT signal, it now initiates a proper shutdown sequence to prevent issues from ongoing operations.

### Plugin-Defined Tables Visible in Main Data Source

Plugin-defined tables can now be displayed in the main data source management interface, making them available for use in blocks and workflows.

## Improvements

### System Tables Use 53-bit Snowflake-like IDs

Update the IDs of system tables that previously used auto-increment primary keys without global uniqueness to 53-bit Snowflake-style IDs for globally unique identification.

### FAQ

**Q:** I bought the Professional Edition before Feb 15, which included Multi-app and Multi-space. Now those features are only in the EnterpriseEdition. Will I lose them?

**A:** No. All features you already own, including Multi-app and Multi-space, are permanently included in your license.

**Q:** I bought the Standard Edition before Feb 15 and have 8 points left. I want to redeem the Approval plugin, but it's now restricted to the Professional Edition. Can I still get it?

**A:** Yes. Your remaining plugin points can still be used to redeem any commercial plugin regardless of the new tiering.

**Q:** I bought the Standard Edition before it included External Data Sources. Now that the Standard Edition includes them (post-Feb 15), do I get them for free?

**A:** Yes. Any new features added to your Edition after Feb 15 are free for existing owners of that Edition. This includes MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and Rest API external data sources.

*The interpretation of these adjustments belongs to the parent company of NocoBase. For existing commercial users, all complimentary rights and adjustments will be finalized by **February 24**.*

We want to thank all our paid and free users, as well as our open-source contributors. We will continue to iterate rapidly to provide a better product at a lower price.

NocoBase 2.0 was officially released on February 15, 2026. Starting with this version, NocoBase is pivoting toward being AI-driven, helping traditional enterprises implement AI capabilities and ensuring AI delivers real value in practical business scenarios. In line with this new direction, we have adjusted our open-source license and pricing structure to ensure the license is more flexible and friendly, the pricing plan is simpler, and the cost of use is lower for our users.

### License Change: From AGPL-3.0 to Apache-2.0

This transition provides a more business-friendly environment, offering users greater flexibility for customization and commercial distribution with fewer constraints.

### Consolidating Remaining Commercial Plugins

Remaining commercial plugins will no longer be sold individually. Instead, they are now **bundled into the Commercial License**. Once you purchase a Commercial License, you gain access to these features.

### Full Credit Toward Upgrades from Lower to Higher Editions

Under the pricing policy prior to February 15, when upgrading from a lower edition to a higher edition, only the remaining prorated value could be credited. For example, if upgrading from the Standard Edition to the Professional Edition after 6 months, with a remaining value of 400 USD, the required price difference would be 7,600 USD.

Under the pricing policy after February 15, when upgrading from a lower edition to a higher edition, the full amount spent on the lower edition can be credited. For example, if upgrading from the Standard Edition to the Professional Edition after 18 months, the full 800 USD spent on the Standard Edition can be credited, and the required price difference would be 7,200 USD.

### Policies for Existing Customers

For users who purchased commercial licenses, plugins, or plugin packs before the transition:

1. Rights purchased before February 15 remain unaffected.
   * All previously purchased or redeemed commercial plugins remain yours.
   * Remaining points in plugin packs can still be used to redeem any commercial plugin.
2. New features added to commercial versions after February 15 will be available for free to users who previously purchased the corresponding commercial Edition.
3. Upgrading from a Commercial Edition purchased before February 15: When upgrading to a higher edition after February 15, the full amount paid for the original edition can be credited toward the upgrade.
4. Upgrading from individual Commercial Plugins to a Commercial Edition: If you purchased commercial plugins before February 15 and wish to upgrade to a Commercial Edition that now includes those plugins, the full amount spent on the original plugins can be credited toward the purchase of the edition.

### FAQ

**Q:** I bought the Professional Edition before Feb 15, which included Multi-app and Multi-space. Now those features are only in the EnterpriseEdition. Will I lose them?

**A:** No. All features you already own, including Multi-app and Multi-space, are permanently included in your license.

**Q:** I bought the Standard Edition before Feb 15 and have 8 points left. I want to redeem the Approval plugin, but it's now restricted to the Professional Edition. Can I still get it?

**A:** Yes. Your remaining plugin points can still be used to redeem any commercial plugin regardless of the new tiering.

**Q:** I bought the Standard Edition before it included External Data Sources. Now that the Standard Edition includes them (post-Feb 15), do I get them for free?

**A:** Yes. Any new features added to your Edition after Feb 15 are free for existing owners of that Edition. This includes MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and Rest API external data sources.

**Q:** I purchased the Standard Edition and the Approval plugin before February 15, for a total of 800 USD + 800 USD = 1,600 USD. Can I credit this amount toward an upgrade to the Professional Edition?

**A:** Yes. The full 1,600 USD can be credited toward the upgrade.

*The interpretation of these adjustments belongs to the parent company of NocoBase. For existing commercial users, all complimentary rights and adjustments will be finalized by **February 24**.*

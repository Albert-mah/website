Recently, a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/1picf8c/looking_for_an_erp/?share_id=O0FYumTWfVjppEHP5Xa8r&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) user was searching for a suitable ERP system for their company. The company is a small business focused on engineering design and construction services and is currently evaluating several ERP solutions.

For small and medium sized teams, many ERP systems appear feature rich at first glance. However, during real world implementation, they often prove to be either overly complex or too costly to deploy, making it difficult to identify which solution truly fits the company’s business structure.

The user highlighted several practical requirements: whether the system supports project based operations, whether it covers core financial and procurement workflows, and whether it can integrate with existing workplace tools.

These challenges are common for many organizations when selecting an ERP system. If you are also looking for [a suitable ERP for a small team](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/best-erp-solutions-for-small-businesses), we previously published a guide on ERP selection for small and medium sized businesses.

As the open source ecosystem continues to grow, a number of mature ERP projects have emerged on GitHub. We previously provided an overall overview in “[10 Most Developer Loved Open Source ERP and CRM Projects on GitHub](https://www.nocobase.com/en/blog/top-10-most-starred-open-source-erp-and-crm-on-github)”. However, open source ERPs with deep AI integration remain relatively limited, as most platforms still depend on plugins or custom development to introduce AI capabilities.

In this article, we take a closer look at three ERP systems on GitHub that are widely discussed in the community and offer AI extensibility or early stage AI integration:

* NocoBase
* ERPNext
* Odoo

We will compare these three systems based on their core architecture, current AI capabilities, and suitable use cases, aiming to provide practical reference points for your evaluation.

If you want a quick overview of the key differences between these AI ERP solutions, you can start with the summary below.
